To set this mod up all you need to do is clone the project and extract:

custom_tooltips.txt
dota_tooltips.rb

into your Dota 2 folder (Steam/steamapps/common/dota 2)

Run the rb script (requires ruby installed)
This will update your dota_english.txt file (you can change this of course)

However, every time Valve updates strings, you will need to run this again.

The custom_tooltips.txt file can be modified to your liking with custom hero names, tooltips, whatever.
Just use /dota 2/game/dota/resource/dota_english.txt as a reference for the structure
