# dota_tooltips
Appends custom strings into your dota localization file. 
WIP
Works to heavily simplify descriptions and pull data away from being inside them.
Includes customized colors for some skills and a blue highlight for aghanims upgrade text.

Colored Skills
Experimenting with colored skill names, some heroes have limited color pallettes between skills (Mirana) while others have an easier time being multi-color (Ogre Magi)

Pudge and Ogre Magi have colored skill names for right now.

Keywords and Colors
Aghanim's Scepter is now colored Blue whenever it is mentioned, and is mentioned slightly more often to help the player notice who has a Scepter upgrade

CHANNELED is now colored Intelligence-Blue #257DAE to draw attention to the spell's mini-stun weakness
MOBILITY is a new keyword colored Agility-Green #167C13 to draw attention to the spell's root weakness
TRUESTRIKE is a new keyword colored pale-yellow #F9FF9E to draw attention to the spell's strength over evasion
