# dota_tooltips
Appends custom strings into your dota localization file. 
WIP
Works to heavily simplify descriptions and pull data away from being inside them.
Includes customized colors for some skills and a blue highlight for aghanims upgrade text.

Colored Skills

Experimenting with colored skill names, some heroes have limited color pallettes between skills (Mirana) while others have an easier time being multi-color (Ogre Magi)

Pudge and Ogre Magi have colored skill names for right now.

Keywords and Colors

Aghanim's Scepter is now colored Blue whenever it is mentioned, and is mentioned slightly more often to help the player notice who has a Scepter upgrade

CHANNELED is now colored Intelligence-Blue #257DAE to draw attention to the spell's weakness to interrupts/mini-stuns.

MOBILITY is a new keyword colored Agility-Green #167C13 to draw attention to the spell's weakness to roots.

TRUESTRIKE is a new keyword colored pale-yellow #F9FF9E to draw attention to the spell's strength over evasion.

Consistencies with word usage.

With the given amount of information in any hero's kit, text, and item choices, there should be a focus in consistent word usage. 
I will be creating a sort of Dota 2 - Dictionary as I progress through this tooltip mod, based on word usage from Valve and the Dota 2 Wikia pages.

Attack: Attacks are the default damage sorce of all units.

Spell: Anything that is not an attack, is exclusively a spell including items. (Is not based on damage types)

Ability: Any Spell granted to a hero by their skill points. (E.g. Zeus and Earthshaker activate their passives from using their abilities)

Other standardizations would be to feature a guiding light to word usage, as this mod isn't limited to in-game knowledge it could be used as a quick to view guide to the framework of how things work. Overall, this should be simple and limited, but for many Alt-Texts I have a "Can Target?" list to help with complex interactions of spells.

Examples:

Spell Immunity / Pierce

Ethereal / Ghost Form

Damage Reduction

Lifesteal / Spell Lifesteal

What can and can't hit invisible units.
